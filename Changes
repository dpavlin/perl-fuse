Revision history for Perl module Fuse

0.16.1 2013-10-31
	- Fix missing "temp" variable declaration in _PLfuse_release,
	  which only affects 32-bit systems using FUSE 2.9.0 or later.

0.16 2013-09-15
	- Fix unbounded stack growth due to previous changes in getdir()
	  and readdir() wrappers that didn't properly decrement SP.
	  [RT #77321]
	- Implement support for FUSE 2.9 specific operations. (flock,
	  read_buf, write_buf, fallocate)
	- Implement helper functions (fuse_buf_size, fuse_buf_copy) for
	  handling generic buffers inside read_buf and write_buf
	  wrappers.
	- Make the write() wrapper do less data copying.
	- Improve compatibility with OpenIndiana (an open flavor of
	  Solaris).
	- Add support for OpenBSD's flavor of FUSE.

0.15 2013-06-08
	- Eliminate more uses of system() in tests.
	- Enable the ioctl() operation when built against FUSE 2.8 or later.
	  Also wrote tests based off fioc.c and fioclient.c from FUSE.
	- Use smaller getattr test sizes only on MacOS X.
	- Permanently fix the XATTR_{CREATE,REPLACE} symbols.
	- Add a wrapper for the poll() operation when built against FUSE 2.8
	  or later. Also wrote tests based off fsel.c and fselclient.c
	  from FUSE.
	- Fixed a thinko in the platform handling chain in Makefile.PL.
	- Added handling for sub-second [amc]time stamps.
	- Improve compatibility with Fuse4X.
	- Improve future compatibility with non-Linux FUSE 2.8
	  implementations.

0.14 2011-08-01
	- Retooling portions of the test facilities, and removing dependence
	  on syscall() and knowing syscall numbers for basic test
	  functionality.
	- Compatibility fixes for Perl 5.8 and Perl 5.13/5.14 with threads.
	- Cleanups to build system, to use pkg-config to get the Fuse
	  build arguments for building our code against the installed
	  libfuse. Cleans up some of the mess before of different ways of
	  handling different OSes; NetBSD is still a bit messy due to
	  librefuse.
	- Decrease file sizes in getattr test, to keep test from running
	  for multiple hours (due to HFS+ not supporting sparse files).

0.13 2011-07-03
	- improved support for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OS X
	- restored non-threaded perl support

0.12 2011-05-20

	- BACKWARD COMPATILIBY CHANGE: readdir introduced in 0.11 changed!

	  opendir, releasedir, fsyncdir, init, destroy, access, create,
	  ftruncate, fgetattr, lock, utimens, bmap

	- Justin Fletcher addition of file handles on open files, RT #57517

0.09_3 2008-03-19
    - really fix 2+ Gb file bug, RT #32639, RT #33903

0.09 2007-11-15
    - support dh-make-perl with fakeroot
    - added fuse_get_context
    - works with MacFUSE http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/
    - added example filter_attr_fs.pl

0.08 2006-11-29 14:24:39 CET
    - fix race condition in test/s/mount.t
    - allow Fuse to be run from a non-master thread
    - CPANPLUS doesn't report errors anymore if fuse isn't installed
    - fix to test helper

0.07 2005-12-25 10:37:00 PST
    - Remove the FUSE_DEBUG constant; we never actually implemented
      it to begin with.
    - "make test" now uses the version of Fuse you've just built,
      not the one installed in /usr/lib/perl5.
    - getattr test now allows blksize to vary between host and fuse
      fs, as this is not a bug.
    - Add experimental support for threading.  The following minor
      API changes accommodate this:
    - The nonexistent (yet documented) "unthreaded=>1" attribute
      has been replaced with the "threaded=>1" attribute, and this
      time it actually exists.
    - Symbolic refs like "main::e_getattr" are now allowed for
      callbacks, because threaded mode needs to share() the
      callbacks, yet perl 5.8.7 does not allow share()ing code
      refs yet.  Direct code-refs are still supported as much
      as possible (currently, non-threaded mode).
    - testsuite uses a multithreaded loopback.pl, when available.
    - Update docs accordingly.  Update examples accordingly.
    - Works on FreeBSD with fuse4bsd http://fuse4bsd.creo.hu/

0.06 2005-04-03 16:15:00 BST
    - Add support for operations supported by FUSE 2.2.1
      (flush, release, fsync, extended attributes)
    - add mount options

0.04 2004-11-18 13:51:56 CET
    - new maintainer, Dobrica Pavlinusic <dpavlin@rot13.org>
    - updated to work with current CVS version of fuse

0.03 2001-12-05 02:17:52
    - changed getattr() to smell like perl's stat()
	- fleshed out the documentation a bit

0.02 2001-12-02 18:59:56
    - works well enough to release, but still needs testing

0.01 2001-11-28 21:45:20
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		include/fuse.h
